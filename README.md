# Funding Circle Ruby Developer Coding Challenge

## Objective
- Write a program that prints out a multiplication table of the first 10 prime numbers
- [x] The program must run from the command line and print one table to STDOUT
- [x] The first row and column of the table should have the 10 primes, with each cell containing the product of the primes for the corresponding row and column.

## Usage
First run `bundle` or `bundle install` in your command line.
`ruby lib/run.rb` - renders multiplication table of first 10 primes
`ruby lib/app.rb 3` - renders multiplication table of specified size
